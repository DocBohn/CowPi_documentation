After *io_test* has been uploaded to your |developmentBoard|, you will see this message in your IDE's Serial Monitor:

..  code-block:: console

    CowPi library version 0.7.0
    The simple I/O test will print the status of the keypad and of each
        button, switch, and LED every time there is a change.

    Keypad:      -        Column pins:  1111
    Left switch: RIGHT    Right switch: RIGHT
    Left button: UP       Right button: UP
    Left LED:    OFF      Right LED:    OFF

For now, no other output is possible.
