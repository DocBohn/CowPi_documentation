There may be other items in the class kit.
Set these aside;
you will not need them for this prelab, though they may be used in a specific lab.


Assembling the Class Kit
------------------------

You will assemble the hardware in the following steps.
**At various checkpoints, you should pause to have a TA, a classmate, or a friend double-check your work.**
When you do so, update the *checkpoints.txt* file to indicate who checked your work and when they did so.

You may want to store your partially- and fully-completed kit in a plastic food container or some other container to prevent jumper wires from being pulled out while in your backpack.

..  NOTE::
    The following pages include diagrams and some photographs of the assembly.
    The wire colors in the diagrams do not match the wire colors in the assembly.
    The wire colors in the diagrams are coded by the purpose they serve, whereas the wire colors in the photographs are the colors of wires removed from the male-to-male rainbow cable.
