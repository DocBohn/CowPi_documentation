Cow Pi mark 1f Construction Instructions (Arduino Nano form factor, |i2c| communication)
****************************************************************************************

These are the instructions to assemble a Cow Pi circuit using an Arduino Nano, a Nano clone, or another microcontroller board that has the same form factor. [#nanos]_

..  TIP::
    In addition to the professor and the TAs, you may freely seek help on this assignment from other students.

In the I/O labs, we will use a microcontroller board with some peripherals. In this prelab, you will assemble the hardware for the I/O labs.

..  NOTE::
    The EE Shop has prepared “class kits” for CSCE 231;
    your class kit costs $30.
    The EE Shop is located at C308 Scott Engineering Center and is open M-F 7am-4pm.
    You do not need an appointment.
    You may pay at the window
    with cash, with a personal check, or with your NCard.
    The EE shop does *not* accept credit cards.

..  CAUTION::
    Access in/through the Scott Engineering Center changes frequently due to construction.
    Starting in the third week of the semester, we will attempt to maintain this page with the best access route.

    | Five-volt microcontroller boards that have the same form factor as the Arduino Nano include the Nano itself and the Arduino Nano Every. Three-volt microcontroller boards that have the same form factor as the Arduino nano include the Arduino Nano 33 IoT, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, and the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.
