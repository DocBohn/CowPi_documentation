Cow Pi mark 1e Construction Instructions (Arduino Nano form factor, SPI communication)
**************************************************************************************

These are the instructions to assemble a Cow Pi circuit using an Arduino Nano, a Nano clone, or another microcontroller board that has the same form factor. [#nanos]_

..  TIP::
    In addition to the professor and the TAs, you may freely seek help on this assignment from other students.

In the I/O labs, we will use a microcontroller board with some peripherals. In this prelab, you will assemble the hardware for the I/O labs.

    | For now, the instructions are particular to Arduino Nano and Nano clones. We will later update the instructions for other boards with the same form factor. Five-volt microcontroller boards that have the same form factor as the Arduino Nano include the Nano itself and the Arduino Nano Every. Three-volt microcontroller boards that have the same form factor as the Arduino nano include the Arduino Nano 33 IoT, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, and the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.
