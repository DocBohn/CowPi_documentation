Similarly, when (and only when) the right button is to the right and you're also pressing the right button, Right LED becomes ON, and the LED that you installed illuminates.



..  CAUTION
    TODO: rewrite the code

    (There may be a delay of about a half-second between you pressing a button and the LED illuminating, and between you releasing a button and the LED deluminating.)
