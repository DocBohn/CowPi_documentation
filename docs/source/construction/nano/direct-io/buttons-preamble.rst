This note applies only to **2-lead pushbuttons**
------------------------------------------------

    .. TIP::
        If your momentary pushbuttons are attached to a cardboard strip with tape, remove them from the cardboard strip.

        If your momentary pushbuttons' leads have metal tabs at the end, you will need to snip off the tabs before inserting the pushbutton leads into the breadboard;
        ordinary scissors will suffice for this task.

        Regardless of whether the leads have metal tabs at the end, you may optionally trim the leads to be about ¼in (6.4mm) long – you can use the exposed lead from a jumper wire as a reference – so that the pushbuttons sit flush on the breadboard.
        It is not necessary that they sit flush;
        this is simply to keep the buttons from wiggling under your fingers.
        *Do not cut the leads shorter than ⅛in (3.2mm)!*

    .. CAUTION::
        Be sure to use eye protection in case the leads' ends fly off when you snip them.

This note applies only to **4-prong pushbuttons**
-------------------------------------------------

    .. TIP::
        The four prongs on a momentary pushbutton are electrically connected as two pairs.
        If you attach the pushbuttons in the wrong orientation, it will appear to the microcontroller as though they are always pressed.
        Fortunately, there is only one orientation that will place the prongs in the specified contact points.
        As long as the prongs are in the specified contact points, your pushbuttons will work fine.
